# Convex_hull
It is utils for computing the distance from
 a target vector to a convex hull.
 
 The following problem can formulate the following QP problem:
 
 $\arg\min_{\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n}\|x - \lambda_1 y_1 + \dots
  + \lambda_n y_n \|$
  
 By now, I use scipy, cvxopt, gurobi to implement the algorithm to
 solve the QP problem. 
 
 Please feel free to use it.
